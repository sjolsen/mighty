;;; This works basically the same way as the code in derp-latest, with the
;;; following important differences:
;;;
;;; - Associative metadata are stored intrusively.
;;;
;;;     This is a big win on speed, and maybe not so much on space (though the
;;;     upper bound on space is almost certainly much better).
;;;
;;; - This implementation uses bounded stack and heap space.
;;;
;;;     The bounded heap is the result of the last point. The particulars of the
;;;     algorithm let us use those same metadata to eliminate stack growth for
;;;     free (and by "free," I mean at the cost of having to manually transform
;;;     the already-complex code into a bastardized sort of CPS).
;;;
;;; - The cache is handled slightly differently (apart from the above).
;;;
;;;     The cache logic in derp is actually slightly more complex than it has to
;;;     be; eliminating the CACHED? predicate and simply initializing the cache
;;;     to the bottom of the lattice (in this case, false) is equivalent.
;;;
;;;     There's another important optimization here that depends on the
;;;     monotonicity that makes the algorithm work in the first place: if the
;;;     cached value is the top value of the lattice (true), then it is
;;;     _necessarily_ the correct value. This is probably not terribly useful in
;;;     large lattices, but here the lattice consists entirely of false and
;;;     true, so it's important. The effect of the optimization is to let us
;;;     rely implicitly on the guesses for many intermediate values without
;;;     running NULLABLEP on them from the toplevel, as would be necessary
;;;     otherwise.
;;;
;;; - The logic otherwise handled by RUNNING? is cleanly separated.
;;;
;;;     In the sake of generality, the original DEFINE/FIXED is designed to make
;;;     the toplevel function a valid entry point for the internal recursive
;;;     algorithm. Apart from hindering delicious local function optimization,
;;;     this means that every iteration along the language chain is branching on
;;;     a dynamically scoped value. Ick.
;;;
;;; - Changedness is tracked through local, lexical variables.
;;;
;;;     Basically the same idea as above. Make life as easy for the compiler as
;;;     possible. Dynamic variables, though certainly an effective solution, are
;;;     not the easiest things to statically analyze.
;;;
;;; - If one sublanguage of a catenate/alternate language is easily computable,
;;;   do it first.
;;;
;;;     Evaluating both sublanguages' nullability isn't actually necessary in
;;;     many cases to decide nullability for the toplevel language (i.e., the
;;;     argument to NULLABLEP). There's a limit to how deep it's useful to look
;;;     ahead (and a small one, too, thanks to exponential growth), but we can
;;;     avoid a fair amount of computation just by computing the delta of (RIGHT
;;;     L) first if it's nonâ€“delta-recursive.
;;;
;;; The sum effect of these optimizations is that NULLABLEP performs _zero_
;;; dynamic memory allocations. In effect, the memory that would otherwise be
;;; dynamically allocated is preallocated in nice, high-locality slots. I'm not
;;; actually sure exactly how SBCL/PCL represents class instances, but I suspect
;;; the difference is an additional four immediate 64-bit pointers for each
;;; delta-recursive language, as opposed to who knows how much on average for an
;;; entry in a full-blown hash-table.
;;;
;;; Some other thoughts:
;;;
;;; - Short-circuiting the value test in AND/OR and OR/OR helps
;;;   performance. Short-circuiting the changedness test kills it.
;;;
;;; - This just does language nullability. I suspect the implementation will map
;;;   more or less directly to parser nullability, but I wouldn't bet money on
;;;   it just yet.
;;;
;;; - These methods may actually be conducive to implementation in, e.g., C++.
;;;
;;;     There's dynamic typing here, and fairly extensive type predicating, so
;;;     plain old "virtual" dynamic typing ain't gonna cut it. Still, though,
;;;     the hierarchy is effectively closed, there's no funky memory allocation
;;;     happening beyond the very cyclic-graph nature of the languages, and C++
;;;     gives you _much_ more control over memory layout than Common Lisp, so I
;;;     bet it's doable.
